- âš¡ Fun fact: Bringing my trade school work (Machinist course) to GMOD and using another method toward my rehabilitation of speaking skills, I want to see how far I have overcome my speech impediment and my language disabilities. Fun fact, I disliked my English teacher from an alternative high school because she didn't see my improvements (blood sweat & tears overcoming my challenges)  in the comprehensive reading test and dismissed me easily when I retook the test. Years later, I am glad to say I have passed grade 9 English officially at the adult center (good enough to speak to people daily!)
